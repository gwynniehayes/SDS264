"""December""",walked 'round the block a thousand times
"""December""",you missed every call that i had tried
"""December""",so now i'm giving up
"""December""",a heartbreak in mid december
"""December""",you don't give a fuck
"""December""",you never remember me
"""December""",while you're pulling on his jeans
"""December""",getting lost in the big city
"""December""",i was looking out your window
"""December""",watching all the cars go
"""December""",wondering if i'll see chicago
"""December""",or a sunset on the west coast
"""December""",or will i die in the cold?
"""December""",feeling blue and alone
"""December""",i wonder if you'll ever hear this song on your stereo
"""December""",i hope you get your ballroom floor
"""December""",your perfect house with rose red doors
"""December""",i'm the last thing you'd remember
"""December""","it's been a long, lonely december"
"""December""",i wish i'd known that less is more
"""December""",but i was passed out on the floor
"""December""",and that's the last thing i remember
"""December""","it's been a long, lonely december"
"""December""",cast me aside to show yourself in a better light
"""December""","i came out grieving, barely breathing and you came out alright"
"""December""",but i'm sure you'll take his hand
"""December""",i hope he's better than i ever could have been
"""December""",my mistakes were not intentions this is a list of my confessions i couldn't say
"""December""",pain is never permanent but tonight it's killing me
"""December""",i hope you get your ballroom floor
"""December""",your perfect house with rose red doors
"""December""",i'm the last thing you'd remember
"""December""","it's been a long, lonely december"
"""December""",i wish i'd known that less is more
"""December""",but i was passed out on the floor
"""December""",and that's the last thing i remember
"""December""","it's been a long, lonely december"
"""December""",i miss your face
"""December""",you're in my head
"""December""",there's so many things that i should have said
"""December""","a year of suffering, a lesson learned"
"""December""",i miss your face (miss your face)
"""December""",you're in my head
"""December""",there's so many things that i should have said (you're in my head)
"""December""","a year of suffering, a lesson learned"
"""December""",i hope you get your ballroom floor
"""December""",your perfect house with rose red doors
"""December""",i'm the last thing you'd remember
"""December""","it's been a long, lonely december"
