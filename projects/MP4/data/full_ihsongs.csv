102, Shape Of My Hands ,met you at that bar where your favourite bands play
103, Shape Of My Hands ,"could barely hear you, forgot to close my five drink tab"
104, Shape Of My Hands ,you couldn't stop talking 'bout the shape of my hands
105, Shape Of My Hands ,singing conor's songs at four in the morning
106, Shape Of My Hands ,while you were online shopping
107, Shape Of My Hands ,you said you need a better mattress
108, Shape Of My Hands ,"i said, ""i'm not staying long enough to see that"""

112, Shape Of My Hands ,i know you are but i still wonder
113, Shape Of My Hands ,now i'm spendin' all my money at 7-eleven
114, Shape Of My Hands ,and sleeping through the weekends
115, Shape Of My Hands ,i tried to catch another fast glance
116, Shape Of My Hands ,but i'm so calculated and you don't make plans
117, Shape Of My Hands ,it's stupid
118, Shape Of My Hands ,i'm losing
119, Shape Of My Hands ,but you quote my lyrics every single night

121, Shape Of My Hands ,i know you are but i still wonder
122, Shape Of My Hands ,are you thinking about me?
123, Shape Of My Hands ,i know you are but i still wonder
124, Shape Of My Hands ,you fucked her to the songs i showed you
125, Shape Of My Hands ,"called me after, bad and broken"
126, Shape Of My Hands ,searched yourself for who you were
127, Shape Of My Hands ,the line went dead but i'm still hopin'
128, Shape Of My Hands ,it's stupid
129, Shape Of My Hands ,i'm losin'

131, Shape Of My Hands ,are you still thinking about me?
132, Shape Of My Hands ,i know you are but i still wonder
133, Shape Of My Hands ,are you thinking about me?
134, Shape Of My Hands ,i know you are but i still wonder
135, Shape Of My Hands ,you remind me of something i scratched on a napkin
136, Shape Of My Hands ,"""it doesn't matter how many people love you"
137, Shape Of My Hands ,"all that matters is how one person loves you"""
138, Shape Of My Hands ,kissed me on the temple when you thought i was sleeping
139, Shape Of My Hands ,"and said, ""you are so..."""
140, Shape Of My Hands ,i never quite caught the last word
141, Shape Of My Hands ,but i'm sure it's the sweetest thing that i've ever not heard

150, Cuff ,in the beast's eyes
151, Cuff ,i've made a lot of friends with couches
152, Cuff ,on the east side
153, Cuff ,it takes a troubled type of freedom
154, Cuff ,to drink all night
155, Cuff ,if you already nailed the sequence
156, Cuff ,am i worth yr time
157, Cuff ,i cuff my t-shirt sleeves
158, Cuff ,and grit my teeth
159, Cuff ,how else can i tell myself i can do most anything?

161, Cuff ,and grit my teeth
162, Cuff ,how else can i tell myself i can do most anything?
163, Cuff ,how else can i tell myself i can
164, Cuff ,come out and meet me on your day off and be candid
165, Cuff ,thank you for being cool and uncross
166, Cuff ,bout what my hands did or didn't
167, Cuff ,and i cuff my t-shirt sleeves
168, Cuff ,and grit my teeth
169, Cuff ,how else can i tell myself i can do most anything?
170, Cuff ,and you cuff my t-shirt sleeves
